**command** | **Vector{String}** | Command is the command line to execute inside the container, the working directory for the command  is root (&#39;/&#39;) in the container&#39;s filesystem. The command is simply exec&#39;d, it is not run inside a shell, so traditional shell instructions (&#39;|&#39;, etc) won&#39;t work. To use a shell, you need to explicitly call out to that shell. Exit status of 0 is treated as live/healthy and non-zero is unhealthy. | [optional] [default to nothing]
